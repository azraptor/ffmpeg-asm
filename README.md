# FFmpeg Assembly Stuffs
A project to learn how to program in x86_64 assembly the way video and audio devs do it.

Largely following [this](https://github.com/FFmpeg/asm-lessons) well written tutorial by the FFMpeg team.

## Building
Currently this project can **only** be built on Linux operating systems.

Install the following `nasm gcc make`, use your favorite package manager.

Execute `make` to build the program.

Run the program like so `./build/vec_test`

More shall be added at some point.
